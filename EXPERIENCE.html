   <p class="w3-container w3-center w3-wide">As we know this year we are not allowed to pulang ke kampung to celebrate hari raya because of the current situation. But its okeyy, raya is still raya 
    eventhough we cannot celebrate it with our big family at village. Furthermore, with today's technology, we can still communicate with each other even though we are far apart. I will share about
	my experience beraya at KL for the first time with my small family. By the way, selamat hari raya everyone :)</p>

 <h1 class="w3-center w3-pink w3-wide w3-myfont">...SELAMAT HARI RAYA...</h1>
<br>
  <p class="w3-container w3-wide">The night before hari raya, me and my younger sister started make our kuih raya. This is our first time make kuih raya together. This is one of the most 
  memorable experience that I had during raya at KL. Because every year when we celebrated hari raya at kampung, usually malam hari raya we just spend our time by just chatting and relax with our relatives.</p>
  <p class="w3-container w3-wide">When the morning come, yaa it is rayaa. we are getting ready to sembahyang raya together. It is definitely feel different when we just celebrate it with our small 
  family but it can be something that are actually memorable for us if we think about it later. Then, we started to eat the raya food that my mom and dad make, such as lontong, rendang and more. Afterwards we take 
  a picture and make a video call with our relatives and friends which is people that are important in our lives and people that we miss so much.</p>
  <p class="w3-container w3-wide">What I can say is there are so many things that I learn and realize from this situation. But overall I am happy eventhough we just celebrate raya at our home and could not visit 
  other people.</p>
